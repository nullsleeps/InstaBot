This requires InstaPy to work, if you don't already have it installed, run: `pip install instapy`

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PERPOSES ONLY, IF YOU INDEND ON USING THIS FOR THE WRONG PURPOSE I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBlE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, YOU WILL BE DOING SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I have only tested this on Firefox, Feel free to test it on other browsers.

`InstaBot:`
Run the Script: Save the code in a Python file (e.g., instabot.py) and execute it using python instabot.py.
Monitor: Watch your account for any restrictions or warnings from Instagram.
Important Notes
Ensure your account isn't private.
Use the bot responsibly to avoid getting banned.

`InstaUnfollow`
Key Components:
`amount`: Specifies how many users to unfollow (`you can change this as needed`).
`allFollowing`: If set to `True`, it will unfollow all the users you're currently following.
`sleep_delay`: Introduces a pause between actions, making it less likely to trigger Instagram's rate limits.

Enjoy :)
